/* WHICH DATA STRUCTURE IS THE BEST */

// What do they do?
// Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

// Why so many???
// Diferent data structures excel at diferent things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

// Why shoud care?
// The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one fo these data structures.
// You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!

// THERE IS NO ONE BEST DATA STRUCUTURE
// They all do diferent things.
// They all excel in diferrent situations.

// Work with map/location data?
// USE A GRAPH!

// Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?
// USE A LINKED LINK!

// Web scraping a nested HTML?
// USE A TREE!

// Need to write a scheduler?
// USE BINARY HEAP!
