/* INSERTION SORT: INTRODUCTION */

// Build up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted.

// Insertion pseudocode
// Start by picking the second element in the array.
// Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary.
// Continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate throught the sorted portion (i.e the left side) to place the element in the correct place.
// Repeat until the array is sorted.
