/* DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING */

// Objectives
// Define what dynamic programming is
// Explain what overlapping subproblems are
// Understand what optimal substructure is
// Solve more challenging problems using dynamic programming

// WTF IS DYNAMIC PROGRAMMIN
// A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solution.

// It only works on problems with optimal substructure and overlaping subproblems.

// Overlaping subproblems
// A problem is said have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times

// Optimal substructure
// A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed form optimal solutions of its subproblems
