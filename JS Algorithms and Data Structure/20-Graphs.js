/* GRAPHS */

// Objectives

// Explain what is a graph
// Compare and contrast differents types of graphs and their use cases in the real world
// Implement a graph list 
// Traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS
// Compare and contrast graph traversal algorithms

// What are graphs?

// A graph data strucuture consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for directed graphs.

// Uses for graph

// Social networks
// Location / Mapping
// Routing algorithms 
// Visual Hierarchy
// File system optimization
// EVERYWHERE!
