// Objectives

// Explain what is a graph
// Compare and contrast differents types of graphs and their use cases in the real world
// Implement a graph list 
// Traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS
// Compare and contrast graph traversal algorithms

// What are graphs?

// A graph data strucuture consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for directed graphs.

// Uses for graph

// Social networks
// Location / Mapping
// Routing algorithms 
// Visual Hierarchy
// File system optimization
// EVERYWHERE!

// Types of graphs

// Vertex -> is a node
// Edge -> conection between nodes
// Weighted/Unwheighted -> values assigned to distances between vertices
// Directed / Undirected -> directions assigned to distanced between vertices

// Adjacency Matrix

// Is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph.
// The elements of the matrix indicate wheter pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.

// Adjacency List

// Is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. 
// Each unordered list within an adjacency list describes the set of neighbors of a particular vertex in the graph. This is one of several commonly used representations of graphs for use in computer programs.
