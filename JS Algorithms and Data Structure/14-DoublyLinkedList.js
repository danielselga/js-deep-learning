/* DOUBLY LINKED LIST */

// Objectives
// Construct a doubly linked list
// Compare and contrast doubly linked list  and singly linked list.
// Implement basic operations on a doubly linked list.

// We know what list are... but doubly?
// Almost identical to singly linked list, except every node has another pointer, the previous node.

// Comparisons with singly linked list
// more memory === more flexibility
// Its almost always a tradeof.
