/* BINARY SEARCH THREE */

// Objectives
// Define what a three is.
// Compare and constrast trees and lists.
// Explain the diferences between trees binary trees, and binary search trees.
// Implement operations on binary search threes.

// What is a three?
// A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship.

// Three terminology
// Root -> the top node in a three.
// Child -> A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
// Parent -> The converse notion of a child.
// Siblings -> A group of nodes with the same parent.
// Leaf -> Node with no children.
// Edge -> The connection between one node and another.

// Threes -> lots of different applications
// HTML DOM.
// Network routing.
// Abstract syntax threes.
// Atificial inteligence.
// Computer file systems.

// Binary search three
// Every parent node has at most two children.
// Every Node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent.
// Every Node to the right of a parent Node is always greater than the parent.

// Binary search three
